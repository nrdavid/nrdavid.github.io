  title={The promise and pitfalls of AI for molecular and materials synthesis},
  abstract = {As artificial intelligence (AI) proliferates, synthetic chemistry stands to benefit from its progress. Despite hidden variables and ‘unknown unknowns’ in datasets that may impede the realization of a digital twin for the laboratory flask, there are many opportunities to leverage AI and large datasets to advance synthesis science.},
